        <p>Hi! My name is Jood Alasiri. I'm a student at Boston University studying Computer Science. From an early age, I have been fascinated by the power of technology and its ability to shape the world we live in. Over the years, my interest in computers has grown significantly, and I’ve found myself drawn to the intricacies of software development, problem-solving, and the endless potential that programming holds.</p>

        <p>My current goal is to gain a broad understanding of Computer Science, while also exploring specific areas like distributed systems and cloud computing. These fields have always intrigued me because they involve solving complex problems at a large scale. Distributed systems, in particular, require a deep understanding of how different components interact with each other over a network, which is both challenging and rewarding.</p>

        <p>In the future, once I have more experience, I plan to specialize in distributed systems. During my studies at Boston University, I took a class that sparked my interest in this area. Even though I didn’t perform as well as I had hoped, I still found the material fascinating. The complexity and importance of distributed systems in today's digital world are undeniable, and I look forward to delving deeper into this field after gaining more hands-on experience in the industry.</p>

        <p>In this section of my online resume, you will find professional information such as my education and projects, as well as personal details like my hobbies and photos from my life. I hope this gives you a good overview of who I am and what I aspire to achieve in the coming years. Feel free to explore and learn more about my journey in the world of Computer Science.</p>
