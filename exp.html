      <h1> My Job Experiences</h1>
      <p>
        Throughout my illustrious career, I have held a variety of roles that have challenged me both mentally and physically. Here’s a look at some of the jobs that have helped shape me.
      </p>

      <!-- Job 1: President of the United States -->
      <div class="eacher">
        <h3>President of the United States</h3>
        <h4>2020-2024</h4>
        <p>
          Serving as the 47th President of the United States, my time in office was full of political turbulence. One of the greatest challenges I faced was debating Donald Trump and countering his endless barrage of conspiracy theories and lies. Despite the obstacles, I maintained composure and led the country through some of its most trying times, all while setting new standards for leadership.

      <!-- Job 2: Astronaut -->
      <div class="eacher">
        <h3>Astronaut – First Woman on the Moon in Louboutins</h3>
        <h4>2020</h4>
        <p>
          As an astronaut, I became the first woman to land on the moon, and I did so with style, donning a pair of Louboutins during the historic walk. Balancing high fashion and space exploration wasn’t easy, but it was an iconic moment for both science and fashion. NASA still talks about the “red soles on the moon” moment to this day! While all the peasants were on lockdown, I was in space.
        </p>

      <!-- Job 3: Pineapple Pizza Advocate -->
      <div class="eacher">
        <h3>Professional Pineapple Pizza Advocate</h3>
        <h4>2022-present</h4>
        <p>
          My most recent role is possibly the most divisive – promoting pineapple as a valid pizza topping. I’ve traveled the world defending this controversial stance, delivering speeches at food festivals, debating world-class chefs, and organizing pineapple pizza pop-up events. My advocacy has made waves in the culinary world, and although balancing presidency and pineapple advocacy was a difficult task, it sparked debates that are still unresolved.
