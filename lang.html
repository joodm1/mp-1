    <h1> Languages</h1>
    <p>
      Over the course of my studies and personal projects, I’ve gained experience with various programming languages, each with its own strengths and typical use cases. Here’s an overview of the languages I code in and how I use them:
    </p>

                <div class="eacher">

          <h3>OCaml</h3>
          <p>
            OCaml is a functional programming language known for its strong type system and pattern matching, which makes it excellent for writing concise and reliable code. I have used OCaml primarily in academic settings for courses that focus on functional programming paradigms and algorithm design. It’s particularly useful for symbolic computation, language processing, and developing compilers.
          </p>
                </div>
                <div class="eacher">
          <h3>SML (Standard ML)</h3>
          <p>
            Standard ML is another functional programming language that emphasizes formal type safety and simplicity. I have utilized SML in coursework that explores the principles of programming languages, type inference, and formal verification. Its strong typing and modularity make it ideal for theoretical computer science applications and teaching fundamental programming concepts.
          </p>

                </div>
                <div class="eacher">
          <h3>Java</h3>
          <p>
            Java is a versatile, object-oriented language that I use for building a wide range of applications, from simple command-line tools to more complex GUI-based programs. Its cross-platform capabilities and extensive libraries make it a go-to choice for many of my projects, including the chess game I developed. Java’s robustness and security features also make it suitable for large-scale enterprise applications.
          </p>
                </div>
                <div class="eacher">

          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p>
            Python is one of my preferred languages due to its readability and ease of use. I often use Python for scripting, data analysis, automation tasks, and prototyping. Its extensive standard library and strong community support make it ideal for quickly developing solutions in areas like data science, machine learning, and web development.
          </p>
                </div>
                <div class="eacher">
            <h3>C</h3>
            <p>
            C is a foundational language in computer science that I’ve used to gain a deeper understanding of low-level programming concepts, such as memory management and system-level operations. I have used C in various courses to write programs that interact directly with hardware, as well as for implementing algorithms that require high performance and fine-grained control over system resources.
            </p>
                </div>
                <div class="eacher">
          <h3>C++</h3>
          <p>
            C++ builds on C by adding object-oriented features, making it suitable for software that requires complex data structures and high performance. I use C++ for projects that demand both efficiency and scalability, such as game development and competitive programming. Its use of classes and templates allows for the creation of modular and reusable code.
          </p>

                </div>
                <div class="eacher">
          <h3>Golang (Go)</h3>
          <p>
            Go, or Golang, is a modern language developed by Google, known for its simplicity, concurrency support, and efficiency. I use Go for building distributed systems and backend services due to its excellent performance, ease of deployment, and ability to handle concurrent processes with goroutines. Go’s straightforward syntax and built-in tools for testing and benchmarking make it a great choice for scalable web applications.
