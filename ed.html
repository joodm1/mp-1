  <h1> My Education</h1>
  <p>
  While studying Computer Science in <a href="https://www.bu.edu">Boston University</a>, My education here has encompassed more than just computer science, so I'll list some of the courses I have taken in both computer science and non-computer science fields.
  </p>

  <h3>Computer Science Courses</h3>

  <h4>CS210: Computer Systems</h4>
  <p>
    An introductory course in computer science where we learned how software and hardware interact within a computer. We used various programming languages and ended the course by creating a calculator in C.
  </p>

  <h4>CS237: Probability in Computation</h4>
  <p>
    This course covered probability concepts with an MIT Ph.D. professor, featuring MIT-style problem sets. It was a really fun course that I wish I could take again to be more present and engaged.
  </p>


  <h4>CS350: Distributed Systems</h4>
  <p>
    A course focused on networks of independent computers that work together to achieve a common goal. This was the most interesting course I have taken and it guides my interest in computer science and future career path. I would love to take it again with Professor Liagouris.

    <h3>Non-Computer Science Courses</h3>

  <h4>RN103: Asian Religions</h4>
  <p>
    This course explored Asian religions, encompassing diverse spiritual traditions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Shinto. We studied various cultures, and the knowledge gained helped me connect with more people on campus and in daily life.
  </p>

  <h4>AN234: Evolutionary Psychology</h4>
  <p class="laster">
    A course in evolutionary psychology that examines how human behavior, thoughts, and emotions are shaped by evolutionary processes. It seeks to understand the adaptive functions of psychological traits and their evolution in solving problems related to survival and reproduction. This course also helped me with daily decision-making, connecting with people, and becoming more sympathetic.
